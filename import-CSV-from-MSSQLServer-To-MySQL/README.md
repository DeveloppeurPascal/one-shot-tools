# Import a CSV dump from MS SQL Server To MySQL

Generate SQL commands to create a database structure from a MS SQL Server dump as CSV files.

This program was made to import a database from MS SQL Server to a MySQL server in 01/2005.

I had to move a website to a new hosting service and change it's technology (ASP to PHP, MS SQL Server to MySQL).

CSV dumps from MS SQL Server are probably not the same now than at this time.

It was a first step of the migration process :
* importing datas in a simple database structure
* migrate old tables and datas to new tables structure

This is a Delphi VCL program for Windows.
