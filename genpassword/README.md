Generates a list of passwords with only letters and numbers.

Choose the number of passwords you need and click on the button to generate them.

Of course, if you want to use this program, make some changes to maximize your security :
* change the number of characters in the password (nowadays 10 is too low)
* add special chars depending on where you'll use the passwords

This project is a Delphi VCL project. It works only on windows platforms depending on your Delphi edition.
