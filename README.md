# One shot tools

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Those programs are simple utilities I created to solve a problem or simplify a task I had.

They probably won't be useful for you, but you can check their source file to see how to do some tasks and adapt them to your needs.

It's Pascal programming language in Delphi, JavaScript or PHP depending on what I wanted to do.

Except if you have issues or questions to share with me, the projects in this repository won't be maintained.

If you are looking for code examples to learn Delphi or basic manipulations look instead at [this repository of examples of all kinds](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples).

This code repository contains projects developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).
