# One shot tools

Those programs are simple utilities I created to solve a problem or simplify a task I had.

They probably won't be useful for you, but you can check their source file to see how to do some tasks and adapt them to your needs.

It's Pascal programming language in Delphi, JavaScript or PHP depending on what I wanted to do.

Except if you have issues or questions to share with me, the projects in this repository won't be maintained.
