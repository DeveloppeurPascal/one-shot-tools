# Rename files in a folder

This program was used to replace the "Dall-E" generated pictures names in a more simple sequence of "dall-e_XXX.png" with a counter as XXX for [the sample website](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Creating-a-Simple-Web-Server-with-WebBroker) of a [DelphiCon 2023 conference session](https://serialstreameur.fr/delphicon-2023.html).

Of course it can be changed to your needs.
